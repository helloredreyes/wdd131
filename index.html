                <div id="about-text">
                    <p>Hello, my name is Rhea June Reyes, but you can call me Red. I am Filipino, but I don't have a talent for singing. I come from a family of seven, along with four dogs and seven cats. Currently, I work in Cambodia as a Marketing Designer, where I primarily focus on multimedia arts. I hold a degree in Biology, but my passion for exploring different fields, particularly arts and cultures, led me to pivot away from a career in science. My ultimate goal is to build a career that I enjoy, allowing me to travel and pursue other interests simultaneously. This is my second semester in Software Development, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to study through BYU-Pathway. It has helped me discover my true passion and what I want to do in life.</p>

                    <p>The Philippines is an archipelago located in Southeast Asia, composed of over 7,000 islands. It is known for its stunning beaches, diverse marine life, and vibrant culture. The capital city, Manila, is a bustling metropolis that blends modernity with rich historical heritage. The Philippines is known for its warm and hospitable people.  The coral reefs in many islands are some of the most diverse in the world making it great for scuba diving and snorkling. I love snorkling in Palawan and Cebu. Filipino and English are the official languages.
